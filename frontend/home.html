                <p>
                  Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are influenced by a variety of factors that can increase the risk of developing heart and blood vessel-related conditions. Understanding these risk factors is essential for prevention and management. Here are the most common risk factors:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension):</strong> When the force of blood against the artery walls is consistently too high, it can damage arteries and lead to heart disease.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>High Cholesterol Levels:</strong> Excess cholesterol in the blood can build up in the walls of blood vessels, forming plaques and narrowing the arteries, which can lead to blockages and increase the risk of heart attack or stroke.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Obesity and Unhealthy Diet:</strong> Carrying excess weight and consuming high-fat, high-sugar, and low-nutrient diets can strain the heart, raise cholesterol, and contribute to the development of CVD.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Smoking and Alcohol Consumption:</strong> Smoking damages blood vessels, reduces oxygen in the blood, and promotes the buildup of fatty deposits in arteries. Excessive alcohol intake can raise blood pressure and weaken the heart muscle.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Lack of Physical Activity:</strong> A sedentary lifestyle increases the likelihood of obesity, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol, all of which are major contributors to cardiovascular diseases.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> A family history of heart disease can predispose individuals to similar conditions. While genetics cannot be changed, adopting a healthy lifestyle can mitigate some of the risks.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Diabetes:</strong> High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels and the nerves that control the heart, significantly increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease.
